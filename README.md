# XVBot-djs
## [Hopefully] A **multi-purpose discord bot** [made using discordjs], __heavy W.I.P__ as of now.  
### As it is still heavily a W.I.P, I have not included the invite link. Hosting your own instance as of now using the base code may or may not work without some debugging/modifying.  

### [Progress/Plans for now]:
#### Completed [as of 19/06/23]:
- Basic Moderation commands.
#### Planned features [as of 19/06/23]:
- Utility commands
- Music commands [hopefully in working state]
- Misc/fun commands.

(Code is free to use and [re]distribute.)
